# CSE 6040 â€“ Computing for Data Analysis (Foundational course)

Computing for Data Analysis! Hands-on programming techniques relevant to data analysis and machine learning. Through a series of projects and assignments, I gained practical experience in fundamental programming concepts and tools essential for data analysis.

## Course Overview
In this foundational course, I cover the following topics:
- programming techniques
- Data processing algorithms
- Numerical linear algebra
- Numerical optimization
- Collection, preprocessing, storage, analysis, and visualization of data
- Programming in Python, R, MATLAB, and SQL

## Projects
My repository includes the following projects, each corresponding to a specific topic covered in the course:
1. **Algorithms for the linear least squares problem.py**: Implementation of algorithms for solving the linear least squares problem.
2. **Association rule mining.py**: Exploration of association rule mining techniques.
3. **Compression via the PCA and the SVD.py**: Application of Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) for data compression.
4. **K-means.py**: Implementation of the K-means clustering algorithm.
5. **Logistic regression.py**: Introduction to logistic regression for classification tasks.
6. **Numpy:Scipy.py**: Hands-on exercises using NumPy and SciPy libraries for numerical computations.
7. **Relational DBs and SQL.py**: Introduction to relational databases and SQL for data storage and retrieval.
8. **Strings and regular expressions.py**: Exploration of string manipulation and regular expressions for text processing.
9. **Tidy data and Pandas.py**: Application of tidy data principles and Pandas library for data manipulation and analysis.
10. **Vizualization tools.py**: Utilization of visualization tools for data exploration and presentation.

## Objectives
- Fill gaps in my programming background necessary for data analysis and machine learning.
- Build foundational skills in programming languages and analytical tools.
- Prepare for programming-intensive courses in the OMS Analytics program.

## Notebooks
The "Notebooks" directory contains Jupyter Notebooks for each project, providing detailed explanations, code examples, and analysis.
